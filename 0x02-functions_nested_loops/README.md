##  C - Functions, nested loops

#### [0.putchar](0-putchar.c)

Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

- The program should return 0

#### [1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](1-alphabet.c)

Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
- You can only use _putchar twice in your code

#### [2. 10 x alphabet](2-printalphabetx10.c)

Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
- You can only use _putchar twice in your code

#### [3. islower](3-islower.c)

Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

- Prototype: int _islower(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is lowercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

#### [4. isalpha](4-isalpha.c)

Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

- Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

#### [5. Sign](5-sign.c)

Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

- Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
- Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
- Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
- Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

#### [6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you](6-abs.c)

Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

- Prototype: int _abs(int);

#### [7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important](7-printlastdigit.c)

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

- Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
- Returns the value of the last digit

#### [8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life](8-24_hours.c)

Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

- Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);

#### [9. Learn your times table](9-times_table.c)

Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

- Prototype: void times_table(void);

#### [10. a + b](10-add.c)

Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

- Prototype: int add(int, int);

#### [11. 98 Battery Street, the OG](11-print_to_98.c)

Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
- Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in order
- The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
- The last printed number should be 98
- You are allowed to use the standard library

#### [12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself](100-times_table.c)

Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.

- Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
- If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything

#### [13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women](101-natural.c)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

- You are allowed to use the standard library

#### [14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A](102-fibonacci.c)

Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

- The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space , 
- You are allowed to use the standard library

#### [15. Even Liber Abbaci](103-fibonacci.c)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.

- You are allowed to use the standard library

#### [16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+](104-fibonacci.c)

Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

- The numbers should be separated by comma, followed by a space ,
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- You are not allowed to use any other library (You can’t use GMP etc…)
- You are not allowed to use long long, malloc, pointers, arrays/tables, or structures
- You are not allowed to hard code any Fibonacci number (except for 1 and 2)
